Procedure:

First, I used ifconfig to find out the ip address, which I found to be 10.161.161.161 on eth1. Then I used nmap to find the active ports ("nmap 10.161.161.161/24") and then used netcat to connect to the port I found at 10.161.161.111, port 21 (tcp) - "nc 10.161.161.111 21". This got me to where I was prompted to enter a user id, which I bypassed with a smileyface - "USER neo:)" and then put password as some random string, which in my case was "PASS yay". After that, I opened a new terminal and connected to port 6200 - "nc 10.161.161.111 6200". I found on Wikipedia (and all over the internet) that this smileyface technique had been an accidental backdoor that was used to bypass login for ftp. After connecting, I was simply able to "ls" and "cat" the secret.txt file, which was "62a28062eb6a3cbd".
