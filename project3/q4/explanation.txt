The procedure was to create a private key using openssl genrsa. Then we created a certificate request using openssl req using the common name of email.gov-of-caltopia.info. Then we sign the certificate with the sign script in the digipwntar folder. This is the certificate that we will use for our local webserver. 
Then we modify pcap_tool.py because that is what will create the spoof packets. If the packet has a DNS layer and the qname of the packet is 'email.gov-of-caltopia.info' then we want to create a new packet with rdata as our IP address(10.0.2.15) which we get with get_if_address. Then we run our webserver and the pcap_tool file. When the governor types his credentials, his info will appear in the terminal.
